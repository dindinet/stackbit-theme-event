Cruise is building the worldâ€™s most advanced self-driving vehicles to safely connect people with the places, things, and experiences they care about.

Since our 2013 founding in San Francisco, we have hired over 1,500 talented individuals and opened additional offices in greater Seattle, Pasadena, and Phoenix. We have raised $7.25B from General Motors, Honda, Softbank, T. Rowe Price, and others. Through our partnerships with General Motors and Honda, we are the only self-driving company with fully integrated manufacturing at scale, building all-electric, zero-emission, self-driving vehicles that will help save lives, reimagine cities, reduce carbon pollution, redefine time in transit, and restore freedom of movement for individuals who live in dense urban settings.

Together, we believe our world-class partners, deep resources, and technology approach of testing in a complex urban environment will help shave years off of our timeline to launch all-electric, self-driving vehicles at scale.
